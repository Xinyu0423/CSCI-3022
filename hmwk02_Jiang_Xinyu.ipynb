Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  Remember that you are encouraged to discuss the problems with your classmates, but **you must write all code and solutions on your own**.\n",

    "- Any relevant data sets should be available under the **Data** module on Canvas, as well as in the zipped folder in which you obtained this assignment. To make life easier on the graders if they need to run your code, do not change the relative path names here. Instead, move the files around on your computer.\n",
    "- If you're not familiar with typesetting math directly into Markdown then by all means, do your work on paper first and then typeset it later.

    "\n",
    "In this problem you will write some code to simulate the game of **Miniopoly** (a very rough approximation of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(game)\">Monopoly</a>).  The game consists of a round board with 40 \"squares\" numbered from $0$ to $39$, where squares $0$ and would-be $40$ are [coincident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coincident) and called **GO**.  A player starts on **GO** with \\$200 in their pocket.  On each turn the player rolls a pair of dice and then moves a number of spaces equal to the sum of the dice.  Landing on different squares have different results: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Squares 2, 7, 17, 22, 33, and 36 cause you to draw a card.  The cards tell you to collect \\$50 or \\$100, or pay the bank \\$25 or \\$100.  There is always an equal probability associated with each of these possible cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Square 20 is **Free Parking**. If a player lands on Square 20, then they are awarded a Free Parking Bonus of \\$500. This should be a generic input variable to your `miniopoly_turn` function called `bonus`, so you can modify it later. But, the default value for `bonus` should be \\$500.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Square 30 is **Go To Jail**. (So if a player has landed on Square 30, then you know they have been to jail.)\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a player starts a turn from **Jail** she rolls two dice: \n",
    "\n",
    "    - If the player rolls doubles (i.e. the dice have equal values), then the player moves from Square 10 a number of squares equal to the sum of the dice\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - If the player rolls anything other than doubles, then she pays the bank \\$20 and remains in **Jail** \n",
    "    \n",
    "<p> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the player passes or lands on **GO** (square 0) she collects \\$200. \n",
    "\n",
    "<p> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the player lands on any other square not mentioned above, she pays the bank an amount equal to the square's number (e.g. if she lands on Square 29 she pays the bank \\$29). \n",
    "\n",
    "<p> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "If at any point the player has \\$0 or less they go bankrupt and the game ends.\n",

It should take as arguments the player's current location on the board as well as the player's current cash reserves and the amount of the Free Parking (Square 20) bonus, and return the player's new location and cash reserves after the turn has completed. Note that if a player goes bankrupt during the game you should return their cash as 0 instead of a negative value.\n",
